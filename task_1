The software development process requires developers to write clear, concise, and efficient code. 
Writing code is only part of the task; testing the code is equally important. 
Developers often use various design patterns to structure their code. 
For example, the Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance. 
Another important pattern is the Factory pattern. This code is a good example. 
The developer must test the code written by the developer. This is the developer's duty. 
The final code must be deployed.
